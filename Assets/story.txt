Story #1: All the Difference in The World
Every Sunday morning I take a
light jog around a park near my home.
Theres a lake located in one
corner of the park.
Each time I jog by this lake,
I see the same elderly
woman sitting at the waters edge
with a small metal cage sitting beside her.
This past Sunday my curiosity
got the best of me, so I
stopped jogging and walked
over to her. As I got closer,
I realized that the metal cage
was in fact a small trap.
There were three turtles,
unharmed, slowly walking around
the base of the trap. She
had a fourth turtle in her lap
that she was carefully
scrubbing with a spongy brush.
Hello, I said. I see you
here every Sunday morning.
If you dont mind my nosiness,
Id love to know what
youre doing with these turtles.
She smiled. Im cleaning off
their shells, she replied.
Anything on a turtles shell,
like algae or scum, reduces the
turtles ability to absorb heat
and impedes its ability to swim.
It can also corrode and
weaken the shell over time.
Wow! Thats really nice of you! I exclaimed.
She went on: I spend a couple
of hours each Sunday morning,
relaxing by this lake and
helping these little guys out.
Its my own strange way
of making a difference.
But dont most freshwater
turtles live their whole lives
with algae and scum hanging
from their shells? I asked.
Yep, sadly, they do, she replied.
I scratched my head. Well then,
dont you think your time
could be better spent? I mean,
I think your efforts are kind and all,
but there are fresh water turtles
living in lakes all around the world.
And 99% of these turtles dont have
kind people like you to help them clean
off their shells. So, no offense
but how exactly are your localized
efforts here truly making a difference?
The woman giggled aloud. She
then looked down at the turtle in her lap,
scrubbed off the last piece of
algae from its shell, and said, Sweetie,
if this little guy could talk,
hed tell you I just made all the difference in the world.
The moral: You can change the
world â€“ maybe not all at once, but one person,
one animal, and one good deed at a
time. Wake up every morning and pretend
like what you do makes a difference. It does.
